                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>
                    Early life:
                    He was conceived on a military base in new mexico by Brigette gossett and jack gossett.
                    He was also born on the same base. This is a story of many military brats but unlike those losers his parents got the hell out of the military. No endless moving for this military baby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Young Years:
                    A demonic child by all accounts, even his own. From hanging with his neighborhood friends to balming his poor brother for spilling oil or various other messes. Children are without souls or at least that's what I say.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Teen life:
                    Highschool did not agree with this teen. After a few years even though this 124 IQ boy had the brains he didn't have the attention to get though. What he did though is get a GED. This lonely boy got no love in high school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Young adult:
                    The Navy oh boy the navy. 3 years on a sub with all the ice cream you could want. Mmmh. Wasn't good for his waistline but it was good for his wallet. But that wasn't the best part. Going on the AT and meeting a bunch of hippies was without a doubt the best time in early adult life. Time to become a truck driver. Yee Haw!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marriage:
                    Finally Scott found love in Meg and got married. His loving ball and chain. Never will he go on multi month adventures alone. A sad day indeed. Now with a house two lovely cats and two loving doggos. In downtown Cincinnati Ohio. Oh how things have changed

            <p>Why have I gone so far as to make a bio on Scott gossett? The answer is quite simple. I'm required to make a bio website for this class!! Now why did I pick Scott? For starters I like him so interviewing him was going to be a blast. I also thought it would be fun to not tell him why I was asking him questions and to host the site afterwards. He is also my inspiration on many things from my love of video games and camping.</p>
